# Annoying Little Shit

The Annoying Little Shit (ALS) is a piece of annoying kit that
wakes up at a random point of time and buzzes loudly.
It has a life of its own and should be small enough to be placed
in hard-to-find places.

The firmware is written for the AVR ATTiny13. The design files for
the device can be found [here](https://github.com/frippertronics/als-hardware)!

The firmware uses the following features:

- Interrupts
- PWM
- WDT
- GPIO 

Requirements:

- CMake
- avr-gcc
